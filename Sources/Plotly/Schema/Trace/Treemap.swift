To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*
